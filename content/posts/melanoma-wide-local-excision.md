Diagnosis: 1.1mm ulcerated melanoma in the left foot

Patient is a 50 year old male who presents with a 1.1mm ulcerated melanoma with 5 mitoses/mm2 for the left foot. He was enrolled in a clinical trial and is on neoadjuvant chemotherapy/immunotherapy (nivolumab, ipilimumab, peninemab). On exam, the patient had a palpable groin lymph nodes. 

The patient underwent videoscopic inguinal lymph node dissection as well as wide local excision of the primary tumor. Surgical specimens for both were sent to inpatient pathology lab. The left groin lymph nodes exhibited metastatic melanoma in 1 of the 7 nodes sent. The primary tumor on the left foot had peripheral and deep margins that were negative for in-situ and invasive melanoma. 

The patient did not have complications in the PACU. The patient was discharged on the same day.

Wide local excision is typically performed with a 1 cm margin for a melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 1mm, with a 2cm margin for a melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 2mm+, and a margin of between 1cm-2cm for margins in between 1mm-2mm. Of note, survival tumors >4.0mm Breslow thickness have about a 50% survival rate while tumors 0.75-1.5mm in Breslow thickness have a 80-96% survival rate. (de Virgilio, Frank, and Grigorian 2015)

Liquid biopsies such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which may be useful for prognosis. One study found that increased levels of ctDNA during melanoma treatment with targeted therapy (e.g. BRAF and MEK inhibitors, dabrafenib, trametinib) may be helpful as a prognostic biomarker for tumor progression, before signs are evident on clinical exam (Knuever et al. 2020) Interestingly, ctDNA detectability in the serum are predictive of having both intracranial and extracranial metastases versus intracranial metastases alone (64% and 0%, respectively) (Lee et al. 2020).
